# LINEAdapter lib

## About
LINEAdapter - is an Node.js library which uses the puppeteer.js to provide you with the program interface of using LINE Chrome extension.

At the current moment, only receiving text messages is implemented.

## How to use

**Preparing environment**

1) install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)
2) open terminal in the LINEAdapter module
3) install [LINE](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/line/ophjlpahpchlmihnnnihgmmeilfjmjjc) Chrome extension


**Setting location of LINE extension**

In the `src/index.ts` file you can find 3 constants: `CHROME_EXTENSIONS_PATH`, `LINE_EXTENSION_ID`, `LINE_EXTENSION_VERSION`. The `LINE_EXTENSION_PATH` is generated by combining all those constants together.

You should set your own path for Chrome extension for `CHROME_EXTENSIONS_PATH` constant.
If LINE extension had updated, you should update values of `LINE_EXTENSION_VERSION` constant;


**Providing login information**

You can fill in your login information in `./src/accounts.json` file.

## Running the application

Use `npm run start` command for running application. Chrome will be launched in headless mode so will not see it. Maybe LINE will ask for entering verification code on your phone. The verification code would be outputted in the terminal in that case.

After successfully logging in, all incoming messages would be read and outputted to terminal.

You can change `./src/index.ts`, for your testing needs.
